            <h2>Dr. Jiang Fan, Founder and Chief Technology Officer</h2>
            <p>Dr. Jiang Fan is founder and chief executive officer of American Lithium Energy (ALE)
              Incorporated and founder and Chief Technology Officer of Amionx. Dr. Fan has more than
              20 years of experience in battery industry with a focus on lithium-ion batteries. Over
              the ten-year history of ALE, Fan has developed advanced, lithium-ion products for both
              military and commercial use. He developed a battery for use in missile launch testing
              that significantly outperformed competitors from four of the largest global battery
              manufacturers. Additionally, Dr. Fan has achieved several milestones in advanced battery
               design. He designed a battery for advanced military applications that doubled the
               flight time of a new weapon system, and he designed a bullet-safe, high-energy battery
                for military helmets using nano-silicon.
                </p>
                <p>Prior to his dual roles as president of
                ALE and CTO of Amionx, Dr. Fan held roles at both Polystor Corporation and more
                recently at Gold Peak Industries. While at Gold Peak Industries, Dr. Fan successfully
                 developed a broad range of lithium-ion products (both round and prismatic),
                 which met Underwriters Laboratories (UL), United Nations (UN), International
                 Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and Japanese standards for both military and
                 commercial applications. He successfully developed a 4Ah 18650 cell with 280
                 Wh/kg, which is about 20 percent higher than 3.5Ah 18650 cell from the industry
                  leader, as well as a military battery BBXX90 battery with 200 Wh/kg, which is
                  about 30% higher than the military current standard BB2590 batteries.
                  Additionally, he established the material and cell performance evaluation
                  laboratory, and UL certified safety-testing laboratory for Gold Peak’s San Diego
                   location. He led the effort in developing both the electrode and cell manufacturing.

                    <p>
                      While at Polystor, Dr. Fan led the efforts in electrochemistry improvements
                    including: cost reduction; better rate capability; longer calendar life; and
                    safety. His work focused on the Partnership of Next Generation Vehicle (PNGV)
                    contract from the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC).
                    Additionally, Dr. Fan qualified new vendors for raw materials used in the
                    production of 18650 cells. He also evaluated various types of electrolytes
                    to improve cell cycle life and low temperature performance. He studied the
                    effects on product quality from variations in the cell and electrode
                    manufacturing processes. He also managed product failure mode analysis.
                    Dr. Fan is a published IEEE author and holds 15 patents in areas such as
                    current limiter and interrupters, electroactive particles and electrodes,
                    and battery and supercapacitor hybrid. Additionally, Dr. Fan raised the
                    capital and built an advanced lithium-ion battery cell factory in Asia with
                     the capability to produce 12 million 18650 cells per year. He holds a
                     Master of Science degree in 1988 from Zhejiang University. He completed
                     his doctorate in Chemistry at Arizona State University
